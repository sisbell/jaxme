	JaxMe (Formerly Apache JaxMe)
    =============================
    
As an Apache project, JaxMe aimed to become an implementation of JAXB. Unfortunately, the project never really
got drive, remained a one-developer approach. As a consequence, the project stagnated until the point, where
it was abandoned.

In order to continue work on JaxMe, the original developer (Jochen Wiedmann) has forked the project off to
Github. The Apache Software License remains unchanged.
