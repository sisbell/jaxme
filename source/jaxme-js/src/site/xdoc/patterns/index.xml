    <p>JaxMe JS comes with a set of generators for implementing
      certain patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="proxy.html">Proxy objects</a> are implementing
        an interface or mimicking another class by delegating
        calls to another object.</li>
      <li><a href="proxy.html#multiple_inheritance">Multiple
        inheritance</a> is an application of the proxy pattern.</li>
      <li><a href="typesafeenum.html">Typesafe enumerations</a>
        are classes with a restricted set of instances.</li>
      <li><a href="chains.html">Proxy chains</a> are an
        implementation of the delegator pattern.</li>
      <li><a href="versioning.html">Versioned database objects</a>
        are basically unmodifiable objects. Updates are actually
        implemented as copying.</li>
    </ul>
