<body>
<h1>The logging framework</h1>
<p>This package provides a minimal logging framework. The approach
is simplistic and designed for reuse of existing other frameworks.
In particular, log4j and the java.util.logging package are being
supported. So is logging to System.err.</p>
<p>Logging works by obtaining a Logger. The Logger is an implementation
of {@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.logging.Logger}.´To get a Logger, use the
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.logging.LoggerFactory}. Available implementations
of Logger use the log4j framework, the Java logging framework, or
System.err. To choose a certain Logger, use the system property
<code>org.apache.ws.jaxme.logging.LoggerFactory</code> or
the resource <code>META-INF/services/org.apache.ws.jaxme.logging.LoggerFactory</code>.
If neither is present, a default implementation will be created.</p>
