<head><title>DB2 support for the SQL generator</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Oracle support for the SQL generator</h1>
<p>This package contains some classes and interfaces enhancing the
SQL generator with Oracle specific features. In particular, these classes
are able to work with Oracle's strange metadata.</p>
<p>The DB2 support works by instantiating a different
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.SQLFactory}: By default, you would enable
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.impl.SQLFactoryImpl}. However, for Oracle
support you would choose {@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.oracle.OraSQLFactoryImpl},
which is a subclass of the default factory.</p>
<p>Likewise, you need to replace the default implementation of the SQL generator,
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.SQLGenerator} with
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.oracle.OraSQLGeneratorImpl}

<p>The difference between the factories is as follows: When using the
DB2 factory, you may cast your instances of
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.SQLFactory},
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.Schema},
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.Table}, and
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.Column} to
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.db2.DB2SQLFactory},
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.db2.DB2Schema},
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.db2.DB2Table}, and
{@link org.apache.ws.jaxme.sqls.db2.DB2Column}, respectively, and use the
additional methods.</p>
