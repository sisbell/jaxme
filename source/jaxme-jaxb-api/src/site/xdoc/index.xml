			<p>
				JaxMe JAXB API is clean room implementation of the JAXB API.
				Unlike the
				<a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">reference implementation</a>
				this one comes under a very moderate open source
				license, the
				<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>.

					<td>
						The reference implementation is now distributed
						from
						<a href='https://jaxb.dev.java.net/'>https://jaxb.dev.java.net/</a>.
                        As of this writing, it will soon be available under the
                        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL
                        (GNU General Public License)</a>.
						Therefore, we continue to recommend our implementation.

			<p>
				In terms of Jar files, the JaxMe JAXB API is equivalent to the
				Jar file jaxb-api-2.1.jar from the reference implementation.
			</p>
			<p>
				JaxMe JAXB API was written as a part of the 
				<a href="http://ws.apache.org/jaxme/">JaxMe 2</a>
				project. It is available as a separate module to be
				included in source distributions of JAXB client
				applications. Perhaps other JAXB provider
				implementations. might be interested too at some point.
