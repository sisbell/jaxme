    <section name="The JaxMe Persistence Management">
      <p>JaxMe Persistence Management means the ability to read JaxMe objects from,
        insert them into, update them in, or delete them from the database.
        These operations are supported by JaxMe's
        <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/ws/jaxme/pm/PM.html">persistence managers</a>.
        </p>
      <p>The word database has a very broad meaning. The PM layer restricts
        itself to the most basic operations. As a result, almost arbitrary
        types of databases may be used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relational databases via JDBC; the
          <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/ws/jaxme/pm/generator/jdbc/JaxMeJdbcSG.html">JaxMeJdbcSG</a>
          may be used to read an existing database schema via JDBC metadata and converts
          the tables into JaxMe objects. For any table, it also creates a specific
          persistence manager, which is a subclass of
          <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/ws/jaxme/pm/jdbc/PMJdbcImpl.html">PMJdbcImpl</a>.</li>
        <li>Native XML databases via XML:DB, a database independent API, much like
          JDBC; native XML databases include <a hrefkey="link.exist">eXist</a>,
          <a hrefkey="link.xindice">Xindice</a>, or <a hrefkey="link.tamino">Tamino</a>. The most important
          difference between native XML and relational databases is, that the formers
          have no limitations on the structure of XML documents being stored.
          <!-- TODO: Link to xmldn.org -->
          As a consequence, there is no need for specific support in the schema
          and <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/ws/jaxme/pm/xmldb/XmlDbPM.html">XmlDbPM</a>,
          the persistence manager for XML:DB, is generic.</li>
        <li>Native XML databases via proprietary API's or protocols; currently this
          only includes <a href="ext:tamino">Tamino</a>
          via the
          <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/ws/pm/ino/InoManager.html">InoManager</a>.</li>
      </ul>
