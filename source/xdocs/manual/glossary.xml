    <glossdef>
      <para>One of the worlds most important open source licenses, originally developed
	    for BSD Unix. It is very liberal: Basically it allows you to redistribute both sources and binaries,
	    as you want. Unlike the GPL you may even sell derivated works. See also

        JAXB (<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/">http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxb/</ulink>)
        is the SUN specification for Java/XML binding.
        It is also available as a reference implementation. JaxMe aims to become another
        JAXB implementation at some time. However, full JAXB support is far from complete.
