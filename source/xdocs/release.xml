    <title>Creating a JaxMe release</title> 
  </properties> 
  <body>
    <section name="Creating a release">
    <p>This page provides information about the steps required to create a
      JaxMe release.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Update the "version" property in "build.xml".</li>
      <li>Make sure that you have the file jimi-1.0.jar in src/documentation/lib.
        This file is required for generating PDF's including PNG images.
        Unfortunately it cannot be added to the repository, due to licensing
        issues. See the Forrest FAQ on how to obtain the file.</li>
      <li>Update the file src/documentation/content/xdocs/news.xml in the
        ws-jaxme repository.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you have gpg or a similar tool installed. The
        easiest way is via the CygWin installer (Windows) or using a
        RPM package provided by your vendor (Linux). If you
        haven't yet created a secret key, do so using "gpg --gen-key".
        Also, create a KEYS file using
        "gpg --list-sigs jochen@apache.org" >>KEYS"
        "gpg --armor --export jochen@apache.org" >> KEYS.
        Add the contents of the KEYS file to "etc/KEYS" in the SVN
        directory.</li>
      <li>In src/documentation/content/xdocs/site.xml: Make sure, that
        the section build.online.site=true is commented out and the
        section build.online.site=false is active.</li>
      <li>Create the distribution files using "ant dist". This will create,
        for example, four files called "ws-jaxme-0.3-bin.tar.gz",
        "ws-jaxme-0.3-bin.tar.gz.md5",
        "ws-jaxme-0.3-src.tar.gz", and
        "ws-jaxme-0.3-src.tar.gz.md5". The extension .MD5 indicates
        that these are no true distribution files, but simply contain
        an MD5 checksum over the others.<br/>
        As of this writing, Java 5.0.4 with Xalan 2.6.0 in Ant's lib
        directory was required to build the site. Other configurations
        failed, due to problems in fop, or jimi.</li>
      <li>Sign all distribution files, creating additional files with the
        same names and an ending ".asc". For example:
        "gpg --output ws-jaxme-0.3-bin.tar.gz.asc --detach-sig
        --armor ws-jaxme-0.3-bin.tar.gz"</li>
      <li>Upload all the files to minotaur.apache.org using scp. For
        example:
        "scp etc/KEYS dist/ws-jaxme-0.3* jochen@minotaur.apache.org:"</li>
      <li>Move the files to the directory /www/www.apache.org/dist/ws/jaxme
        and ensure proper permissions:
        "chgrp ws KEYS ws-jaxme-0.3*"
        "chmod 664 KEYS ws-jaxme-0.3*"
        "mv KEYS ws-jaxme-0.3* /www/www.apache.org/dist/ws/jaxme"</li>
      <li>Update the file "/www/www.apache.org/dist/ws/jaxme/README.html".</li>
      <li>Upload numbered versions of the jars released to the Apache Java Repository
        together with md5 sums and signatures. At the moment, this should be done by
        uploading to your home directory on www.apache.org and then moving them into the
        /www/www.apache.org/dist/java-repository/jaxme/jars/. Finally, update the 
        SNAPSHOT symlinks in that directory. Note that the processes for the repository
        are still under development so it would probably be a good idea to 
        contact the repository team (subscribe to repository at apache.org).</li>
      <li>In src/documentation/content/xdocs/downloads.ehtml: Add the new
        version and the checksums.</li>
      <li>Build a new version of the online site. See the separate section
        below.</li>
      <li>Wait one day, until the Apache mirrors are in sync.</li>
      <li>Update the files mirrors.ehtml and news.xml in the directory
        src/documentation/content/xdocs of the ws-site repository.</li>
      <li>Announce the new release on <link href="ext:freshmeat">FreshMeat</link>.
        There are three projects that might need notifications: JaxMe, JaxMeJS, and
        JaxMeXS. Creating an announcement on freshmeat requires that you have an
        account and be administrator for the respective projects. If you aren't
        yet, contact <link href="mailto:jochen@apache.org">Jochen Wiedmann</link>.</li>
      <li>Announce the new release on all Apache appropriate mailing lists. This should include
      the JaxMe list and the announcement lists for the WebServices and Xml projects.
      Note that it is important to include a description of JaxMe when posting 
      announcements to project level lists. Note that you should post from your apache
      email address and you will need to subscribe.</li>
    </ol>

	<section name="Creating the online site">
	  <p>The online site is created like this:</p>
	  <ol>
        <li>In src/documentation/content/xdocs/site.xml: Make sure, that
          the section build.online.site=false is commented out and the
          section build.online.site=true is active.</li>
        <li>Run the build script: "ant -Dbuild.online.site=true clean Docs.all".</li>
        <li>To export the contents of build/docs/build/site to the ws-site
          directory, extract the CVS module ws-site/targets/jaxme (for example,
          to /tmp/jaxme and run "ant -Dws.site.dir=/tmp/jaxme export.site".
          After checking in this directory, everything should work well.</li>
