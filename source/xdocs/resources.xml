    <section name="JaxMe Jelly Tag Library">
        <p>
<link href='ext:jelly'>Jelly</link> is a tool for turning XML into executable code.
One common use is to drive complex build scripts typically embedding ant but Jelly's
flexibility is it's strength. There are many uses to which Jelly can be put.
        </p>
        <p>
Jelly is extensible. The principle way that Jelly can be extended is through jelly
tag libraries. If you know JSP custom tags, then this idea should be pretty familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
(Basic) Jelly tag libraries for JaxMe can be found  
<link href='ext:jaxme-jelly-tag-library'>here</link> and a list of tags
<link href='ext:jaxme-jelly-tags'>here</link>.
