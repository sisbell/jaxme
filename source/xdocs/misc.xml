    <section name="Clover">
      <p><link href="site:clover">Clover</link> is a tool that allows to trace the
      	coverage of a test suite. In short, you compile your classes using clover,
      	run the unit tests and finally receive a report which tells you, which
      	methods and lines are covered by the unit tests and, more important,
      	which aren't.</p>
      <p>The nice thing with Clover is, that it is available at no cost for
      	open source projects like JaxMe. In other words, one can use it to
        determine the coverage of JaxMe's test suite. Here's how to do that:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>To obtain a copy of Clover, you have to use the
      	  <link href="site:cloverkey">JaxMe license key</link>. After accepting
      	  the Clover license, you may download a ZIP file with "Clover for Ant".
      	  Extract the file and copy the file lib\clover.jar to the lib folder
      	  in your Ant home directory.</li>
      	<li>Choose a temporary directory. In what follows, I will assume /tmp/cloverdb.</li>
      	<li>Invoke the following Ant targets, in the same order</li>
      </ol>
      <source>
      	ant clean
      	ant -Dbuild.clover.db=/tmp/cloverdb all
      	ant -Dbuild.clover.db=/tmp/cloverdb test
      	ant -Dbuild.clover.db=/tmp/cloverdb test
      	ant -Dbuild.clover.db=/tmp/cloverdb clover.swing
      </source>
      <p>Don't ask me, why we have to call the "test" target twice. Alternatively
      	you may replace "clover.swing" with "clover.html": This will create a
      	set of HTML files with the same report.</p>
